It visibly improves a range of skin issues, including ageing skin, acne, congestion, sebum imbalances, skin imperfections, thickened skin and scars. \n\nYou will see noticeable results after one treatment; however, a course of at least three treatments, 3-4 weeks apart, is advisable for long-term results. \n\nYou can choose to combine the following add-on treatments to enhance the effects of the Aqua-3 hydrotherapy facial:\n\n- Black Head Extraction\n- Dermaplaning for an extra-smooth finish\n- LED Light Therapy to soothe skin and boost rejuvenation by stimulating collagen production\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nAfter the first treatment, your skin will appear noticeably smoother and glowing.

After this, skin quality is improved. \n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nAvoid sun exposure for 48 hours after this treatment. It is advisable to use a sun-protection factor (SPF) cream after all treatments.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\n- One Aqua-3 hydrotherapy facial costs £130.\n- A course of three treatments costs £351.\n- A course of six treatments costs £663.",

They can also target sun damage, acne, scarring, rosacea, fine lines, open pores, brown spots and more.\n\nDuring a peel, a natural acid is applied to the skin. This removes the dead cells on the surface to reveal fresher, softer skin. Peels stimulate the production of collagen, which helps keep the skin plump and elastic. They can also even out melanin (skin pigmentation). \n\nSkin peels are suitable for anyone looking to refresh and revive their skin. They can visibly improve a range of conditions, including ageing skin, acne, brown spots, sun damage and scars.  They are suitable for all skin types and can be tailored to specific concerns. Skin peels can even help strengthen the skin and reduce sensitivity.\n\nThe number of treatments depends on your particular skin concern. For issues such as ageing skin, hyperpigmentation (brown patches), or acne, a course of two or more treatments may be needed. Your therapist will be able to advise you on this.\n\nYou can choose to combine the following add-on treatments to enhance the effects of the Skin Peel:\n\n- Dermaplaning for an extra-smooth finish\n- LED Light Therapy to soothe skin and boost rejuvenation by stimulating collagen production\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nYou might experience some temporary redness and irritation.

  "content": "#### What is Radio Frequency Skin Tightening?\n\nRadio frequency works by delivering heat into the deeper layers of the skin, which stimulates collagen production. Boosting the number of collagen fibres tightens, lifts and plumps up the skin. \n\nThis treatment is suitable for anyone looking for more youthful, radiant skin. It is ideal for wrinkles, lines, sagging and enlarged pores. It can also make dull skin look dewier and more radiant and can prevent or delay the first signs of ageing.\n\nA course of at least six weekly treatments is recommended to see visible and long-lasting effects. Your therapist can advise you on the appropriate number of treatments for your particular concern. Many clients repeat a course once or twice a year to maintain the effects.\n\nYou can choose to combine the following add-on treatments to enhance the effects of the Radio Frequency Skin Tightening:\n\n- Dermaplaning for an extra-smooth finish\n- LED Light Therapy to soothe skin and boost rejuvenation by stimulating collagen production\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nYou may experience some redness, swelling and mild heat for a few hours after the treatment. \n\nMany people see a tightening effect after their first treatment; however, as radiofrequency promotes collagen production for up to 6 weeks following a treatment, you will continue to see improvements in your skin for weeks afterwards.\n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nKeep hydrated after your radiofrequency skin tightening treatments by drinking water. If your skin feels hot after the treatment, a cooling gel can help. It is advisable to use a sun-protection factor (SPF) cream after all treatments.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\n- One radiofrequency treatment costs £120.\n- A course of three treatments costs £324.\n- A course of six treatments costs £612.",

  "title": "IPL Skin Rejuvenation",
  "content": "#### What is IPL Skin Rejuvenation ?\n\nIntense pulsed light (IPL) skin rejuvenation is a safe and non-invasive method that can correct skin concerns such as rosacea, birthmarks, brown spots, thread and spider veins, pigmentation, sun damage and ageing skin. It is suitable for most skin types.\n\nIn IPL, a broad range of light wavelengths are pulsed onto the skin. The light penetrates just below the skin’s surface, where it disrupts melanin (skin pigment) and small blood vessels (which may be responsible for spider veins or rosacea). This triggers the skin’s repair mode and increases collagen production. The result is a visible reduction in imperfections and improvement in skin condition.\n\nThe number of treatments depends on your particular concern. For most skin imperfections, a course of 3-6 monthly treatments is recommended. Your therapist can advise you on the appropriate number of treatments.\n\nYou can choose to combine the following add-on treatments to enhance the effects of the IPL Skin Rejuvenation:\n\n- Dermaplaning for an extra-smooth finish\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nThe skin may look red and feel sensitive, similar to mild sunburn, for a few hours after your treatment. Some people may experience a slight swelling that subsides. Skin sensitivity can continue for up to 48 hours as your skin recovers.\n\nBrown spots typically become darker for 24 hours following treatment then fade away over the next 1-2 weeks. Conditions such as rosacea and generalised ageing may need more time and treatments for visible changes to be seen.\n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nIf your skin feels hot after the treatment, applying a cooling gel can help. It is advisable to use a sun-protection factor (SPF) cream and stay out of the sun after IPL.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\n- One IPL skin rejuvenation treatment costs £110.\n- A course of three treatments costs £297.\n- A course of six treatments costs £561.\n\n**Please note: a patch test is required for all new customers booking this treatment, please book a Patch Test appintment first**",

This treatment can fade away acne scars, stretch marks and brown spots. It can also boost radiance, plump up the skin and reduce enlarged pores, sagging and wrinkles. \nThe Dermapen makes tiny punctures in the skin, which aid the penetration of active serums. It also stimulates skin renewal and the production of collagen and elastin, responsible for young-looking skin. \nDermapen is an FDA-approved device that has been shown to provide greater results and less discomfort than a roller.\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nYou may see results after the first treatment; however, it usually takes 4-6 weeks to see significant changes in your skin. \n\nWith Dermapen, your skin may also feel warm and tight and you may experience temporary redness and swelling, a bit like sunburn. This usually subsides within 1-2 days and  depends on the needle depth used, your skin concern and skin type. Your therapist will discuss this with you during your initial consultation.\n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nAvoid very hot or cold water, swimming and tanning after your treatment. It is also advisable to use a sun-protection factor (SPF) cream after all treatments. Your therapist will give you more specific advice about what products to use on your skin after micro-needling.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\n- One treatment costs £200.\n- A course of four treatments costs £720.",

This creates tiny injuries in the skin that kickstart the wound-healing response. The result is tissue renewal, skin tightening and increased production of collagen and elastin, responsible for plump and youthful skin. \n\nThe number of treatments needed to see results varies from person to person. Usually 1-3 treatments are needed.\n\nPlease book a Consultation before treatment so we can assess your suitability for plasma lift and to discuss any questions you may have.\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nYou will have small red dots all over the treatment area that scab over and fall off after about a week. As your skin recovers over the next two weeks, the full effects of the treatment will be seen. \n\nYou could see results after one treatment, but it might take up to three treatments to see a difference. Results can last for up to a year after treatment.\n\nDuring your initial consultation, your therapist will discuss all possible effects after treatment.\n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nYour therapist will advise you about after care for this treatment. \n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\nPrices range from £350 for a lower eye lift to £2,000 for the whole face.

Other benefits include improved appearance of acne scars, removal of trapped dirt and oil, and improved absorption of skincare products.  \n\nDermaplaning is suitable for all skin types and ages. It is an excellent treatment to prep the skin before undergoing any other advanced skin treatments. It is available to book as an add-on treatment as well. \n\nSome people opt for dermaplaning to look their best before a special event. For those who want to maintain the effect, treatments every 3-4 weeks are recommended.\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nYou will probably see improvements straight after your treatment; however, it often takes several days to see full results. The effects disappear after about 3-4 weeks.\n\nThe fine hair on the face does not grow back thicker after dermaplaning.\n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nYour skin will be more receptive to serum after dermaplaning.

  "content": "#### What is electrolysis?\n\nElectrolysis is a safe and proven method of permanent hair removal. Unlike other techniques, hairs are removed individually. It works by sending a targeted electrical current down the hair shaft, which kills the hair at its root.\n\nElectrolysis is effective on all hair colours, including white and blonde hairs. \n\nHair grows in a three-stage cycle. For electrolysis to permanently remove a hair, it must be in the anagen (growing) phase. For this reason, multiple treatments may be needed to catch the hair in the anagen phase.\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nYour therapist will tell you what to expect at your initial consultation. After several sessions, many people experience permanent hair removal with electrolysis. As with all treatments, results vary from person to person. \n\nSide effects are uncommon. After a treatment, the area might feel hot and sore and look red or bumpy. This should subside within a few hours to a couple of days. You might also see tiny pin-sized scabs, which will heal over.\n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nKeep the area clean, avoid exfoliation, skin acids (eg, glycolic and salicylic acid acid) and excessive heat for 48 hours. It is advisable to stay out of the sun and use sun protection after all treatments.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\n- 10 minutes: £20\n- 15 minutes: £30\n- 30 minutes: £40\n- 60 minutes: £60",

This stimulates collagen production and blood circulation, and triggers fat deposits to break down. The result is firmer and tighter skin and a reduction in cellulite. \n\nThis treatment is especially popular for the upper arms, waist, hips and thighs.\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nMany people see an effect after their first treatment, although it can take several sessions to see a difference. Results vary between individuals.\n\nYou might experience some redness, mild swelling and heat for a few hours after your treatment. \n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nKeep hydrated after your fat and cellulite reduction treatment by drinking water. If your skin feels hot after your treatment, a cooling gel can help. It is advisable to use a sun-protection factor (SPF) cream after all treatments.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\n30-minute treatment: \n\n- One treatment costs £80.\n- A course of six treatments costs £408.\n- A course of eight treatments costs £544.\n\n60-minute treatment:\n\n- One treatment costs £120.\n- A course of six treatments costs £612.\n- A course of eight treatments costs £816.\n",

  "title": "IPL Laser Hair Removal",
  "content": "#### What is IPL hair removal?\n\nThis treatment uses a device that emits intense pulsed light (IPL) to remove hair. The light travels through the skin’s layers and targets melanin (pigment) in the hair shaft and root. The melanin in the hair absorbs light, becomes very hot and is destroyed. \n\nIPL is only able to remove hairs that are actively growing. For this reason, 6-8 treatments, 4-6 weeks apart, are needed to catch all hairs in the active phase.\n  \n#### What should I expect after the treatment?\n\nAfter IPL, it is normal for the treated area to feel as if it is sunburned. Aloe vera gel and cold compresses can help soothe the skin if this is the case. In some cases, the treated area can become red and bumpy. This can last from two hours to a few days, depending on your skin type. \n\n#### What is the after care?\n\nOpt for loose clothing for comfort straight after treatment if possible. It is important to avoid all sun exposure, sunbeds and self-tanning products before and after IPL. Avoid hair removal (eg, tweezing, waxing and depilatory creams) as this can affect the success of the treatment. If necessary, hair can be shaved between sessions. It is normal for hair to shed after treatments. This can be encouraged using exfoliation.\n\nKeep away from heat, such as saunas, hot showers and baths for 2-3 days. Avoid products containing Retin-A (tretinoin), retinol, benzoyl peroxide, astringents, chemical peels, glycolic and salicylic acids, and any possible irritants for at least 2 days.\n\n#### How much does it cost?\n\nFor a small area, a single treatment costs £40 and £204 for a course of 6 treatments. \n\nFor a medium area, a single treatment costs £80 and £408 for a course of 6 treatments. \n\nFor a large area, a single treatment costs £120 and £612 for a course of 6 treatments. \n\n**Please note: a patch test is required for all new customers booking this treatment, please book a Patch Test appintment first**",
