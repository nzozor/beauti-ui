        All of our nail treatments come with a standard 5-step of care: first we will carefully file your nails to
        your prefered shape, then your cuticle will be gentally pushed back, depending on the type of your nail polish,
        your hands or feet will be exfoliated and apply a moisturizing mask before or after we apply the colours, ending
        with a relaxing massage. If your feet need extra care and attention to remove corns, callus and the build up of dry skin,
         a very Italian styled Medical Pedicure is perfect option for you.`,
